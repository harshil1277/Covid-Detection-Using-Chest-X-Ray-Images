# Covid-Detection-Using-Chest-X-Ray-Images

It is a Course Project for course "Pattern Recoginition and Machine Learning".


Employed advanced techniques including LDA, PCA, UNet, Filters, ANN, and CNN on both RGB and gray-scale channels to develop and train various models for accurate Covid detection from X-ray images.


Conducted thorough analysis and experimentation on masked data toassess the performance and effectiveness of different techniques, focusing on achieving high accuracy and reliability.


Evaluated and compared the trained models to identify the most optimal approach that provides both high accuracy and recall, ensuring suitability for deployment in Medical Industry.
